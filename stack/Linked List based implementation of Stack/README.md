# Performance & Limitations
### Performance
Let n be the number of elements in the stack. The complexities for operations with this
representation can be given as:
| Operation | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Space Complexity (for n push operations) | O(n) |
| Time Complexity of Push() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of Pop() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of printing the Stack | O(n) |
