# Queue

![Queue](https://github.com/nandanabhishek/Data-Structure/blob/main/Queue/queuefinal.jpeg)

#### A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 
####  The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
